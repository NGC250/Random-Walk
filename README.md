# Random-Walk
Brownian motion/Random walk

Random walk is an age-old problem involving a drunkard and a lightpost. The drunkard takes a step away from the lightpost in any random direction
and continues to do so for a given number of steps. The problem aims to solve the average displacement of the drunkard from the lightpole after N
steps. If the drunkard takes a step of size s everytime they walk, the statistical average of the displacement from the light pole = s*âˆšN.
